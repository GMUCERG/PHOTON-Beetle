Na, Nm, Nc, Nh : The number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc, Inh : Binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
Bla, Blm, Blc, Blh : The number of bytes in the incomplete block of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively

a. Reference software implementation
	photonbeetleaead128rate128v1
       	photonbeetlehash256rate32v1
	[NIST LWC Round 1 Candidates Page]*

b. Design Goal
	- Focused on throughput
	- Constraints: 
		- 2k LUTs
		- 0 BRAMs/DSPs

c. Supported maximum sizes of inputs
	2^50-1

d.  Non-default values of generics and constants
	N/A
 
e. Block sizes
	AD Block Size: 128 bits
	PT/CT Block Size: 128 bits
	Hash Message Block Size: 32 bits

f. Execution times
	
	Execution time of authenticated encryption: 
		8+(1+28*Na)+Ina+(1+28*Nm)+Blm+Inm+29
	Execution time of authenticated decryption: 
		8+(1+28*Na)+Ina+(1+28*Nm)+Blm+Inm+30
	Execution time for hashing:
		7+(25*(|Nh-4|))+56

g. Authentication throughput for large messages

    Authentication Throughput for large Na = 128 / (29 * T) = 4.4138 * f
    Encryption Throughput for large Nm = 128 / (33 * T) = 3.8788 * f
    Decryption Throughput for large Nc = 128 / (33 * T) = 3.8788 * f
    Hashing Throughput for large Nh = = 32 / (25 * T) = 1.28 * f

h. Difference between execution times for a new key and the same key
	
	5 (4 for s_store_key, 1 for extra wait cycle in s_load_n)
